# Hi, I am Aravind 👋

## I am a User Researcher and Engineer building tools and processes for the new age of AI powered applications.

I'm an experienced industry researcher with background in Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science. I specialize in building highly technical enterprise grade products.

In several areas of my life, I consider myself a deep generalist. My super power is to systematically understand complex new domains and help teams build user-centered products within them. I enjoy sharing and teaching these discoveries through writing and mentorship.
